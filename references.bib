  abstract  = {We present a reconstruction of session types in a conventional pi calculus where types are qualified as linear or unrestricted. Linearly typed communication channels are guaranteed to occur in exactly one thread, possibly multiple times. We equip types with a constructor that denotes the two ends of a same communication channel. In order to assess the flexibility of the new type system, we provide three distinct encodings (from the linear lambda calculus, from the linear pi calculus, and from the pi calculus with polarized variables) into our system. For each language we present operational and typing correspondences, showing that our system effectively subsumes the linear pi calculus as well as foregoing works on session types.},

The three primitives enable programmers to elegantly describe complex interactions among processes with a rigorous type discipline similar to ML [4]. The language is given formal operational semantics and a type inference system, regarding which we prove that if a program is well-typed in the typing system, it never causes run-time error due to type inconsistent communication patterns, offering a new foundation for type discipline in parallel programming languages.},

Celf is an implementation of the CLF type theory that extends the LF type theory by linear types to support representation of state and a monad to support representation of concurrency. It relies on the judgments-as-types methodology for specification and the interpretation of CLF signatures as concurrent logic programs [LPPW05] for experimentation. Celf is written in Standard ML and compiles with MLton, MLKit, and SML/NJ. The source code and a collection of examples are available from http://www.twelf.org/{\textasciitilde}celf.},

  abstract      = {Work to date on combining linear types and dependent types has deliberately and successfully avoided doing so. Entirely fit for their own purposes, such systems wisely insist that types depend only on the replicable sublanguage, thus sidestepping the issue of counting uses of limited-use data either within types or in ways which are only really needed to shut the typechecker up. As a result, the linear implication (`lollipop') stubbornly remains a non-dependent {\$}{\$}S {\backslash}multimap T{\$}{\$}S⊸T. This paper defines and establishes the basic metatheory of a type theory supporting a `dependent lollipop' {\$}{\$}(x{\backslash}!:{\backslash}!S){\backslash}multimap T[x]{\$}{\$}(x:S)⊸T[x], where what the input used to be is in some way commemorated by the type of the output. For example, we might convert list to length-indexed vectors in place by a function with type {\$}{\$}(l{\backslash}!:{\backslash}!{\backslash}mathsf {\{}List{\}}{\backslash},X){\backslash}multimap {\backslash}mathsf {\{}Vector{\}}{\backslash},X{\backslash},({\backslash}mathsf {\{}length{\}}{\backslash},l){\$}{\$}(l:ListX)⊸VectorX(lengthl). Usage is tracked with resource annotations belonging to an arbitrary rig, or `riNg without Negation'. The key insight is to use the rig's zero to mark information in contexts which is present for purposes of contemplation rather than consumption, like a meal we remember fondly but cannot eat twice. We need no runtime copies of l to form the above vector type. We can have plenty of nothing with no additional runtime resource, and nothing is plenty for the construction of dependent types.},

  abstract      = {Several type disciplines for $\pi$-calculi have been proposed in which linearity plays a key role, even if their precise relationship with pure linear logic is still not well understood. In this paper, we introduce a type system for the $\pi$-calculus that exactly corresponds to the standard sequent calculus proof system for dual intuitionistic linear logic. Our type system is based on a new interpretation of linear propositions as session types, and provides the first purely logical account of all (both shared and linear) features of session types. We show that our type discipline is useful from a programming perspective, and ensures session fidelity, absence of deadlocks, and a tight operational correspondence between $\pi$-calculus reductions and cut elimination steps.},

  abstract      = {Extending the pi calculus with the session types proposed by Honda et al. allows high-level specifications of structured patterns of communication, such as client-server protocols, to be expressed as types and verified by static typechecking. We define a notion of subtyping for session types, which allows protocol specifications to be extended in order to describe richer behaviour; for example, an implemented server can be refined without invalidating type-correctness of an overall system. We formalize the syntax, operational semantics and typing rules of an extended pi calculus, prove that typability guarantees absence of run-time communication errors, and show that the typing rules can be transformed into a practical typechecking algorithm.},
