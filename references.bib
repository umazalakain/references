  abstract = {Thanks to recent advances, modern proof assistants now enable verification of realistic sequential programs. However, regarding the concurrency paradigm, previous work essentially focused on formalization of abstract systems, such as pure concurrent calculi, which are too minimal to be realistic. In this paper, we propose a library that enables verification of realistic concurrent programs in the Coq proof assistant. Our approach is based on an extension of the {$\pi$}-calculus whose encoding enables such programs to be modeled conveniently. This encoding is coupled with a specification language akin to spatial logics, including in particular a notion of fairness, which is important to write satisfactory specifications for realistic concurrent programs. In order to facilitate formal proof, we propose a collection of lemmas that can be reused in the context of different verifications. Among these lemmas, the most effective for simplifying the proof task take advantage of confluence properties. In order to evaluate feasibility of verification of concurrent programs using this library, we perform verification for a non-trivial application.},

As a result, we show indexed containers provide normal forms for strictly positive families in much the same way that containers provide normal forms for strictly positive types. Interestingly, this step from containers to indexed containers is achieved without having to extend the core type theory. Most of the construction presented here has been formalized using the Agda system.},

To verify this code, we invented new inference rules for reasoning about expressions with side effects, which occur often in C. We also formalized aspects of Unix file systems and processes, operating system and library calls, parts of the C language, and security properties. We propose an architecture for a software verification system which could be widely useful, and argue that our proof demonstrates that real world software written in real world languages can be verified.},

  abstract = {The {$\pi$}-calculus, viewed as a core concurrent programming language, has been used as the target of much research on type systems for concurrency. In this paper we propose a new type system for deadlockfree session-typed {$\pi$}-calculus processes, by integrating two separate lines of work. The first is the propositions-as-types approach by Caires and Pfenning, which provides a linear logic foundation for session types and guarantees deadlock-freedom by forbidding cyclic process connections. The second is Kobayashi's approach in which types are annotated with priorities so that the type system can check whether or not processes contain genuine cyclic dependencies between communication operations. We combine these two techniques for the first time, and define a new and more expressive variant of classical linear logic with a proof assignment that gives a session type system with Kobayashi-style priorities. This can be seen in three ways: (i) as a new linear logic in which cyclic structures can be derived and a Cycle-elimination theorem generalises Cut-elimination; (ii) as a logically-based session type system, which is more expressive than Caires and Pfenning's; (iii) as a logical foundation for Kobayashi's system, bringing it into the sphere of the propositionsas-types paradigm.},

It extends Backhouse's `Do-It-Yourself Type Theory' to include inductive definitions of families of sets and definitions of functions by recursion on the way elements of such sets are generated. The formulation is in natural deduction and is intended to be a natural generalisation to type theory of Martin-L{\"o}f's theory of iterated inductive definitions in predicate logic.
Formal criteria are given for correct formation and introduction rules of a new set former capturing definition by strictly positive, iterated, generalised induction. Moreover, there is an inversion principle for deriving elimination and equality rules from the formation and introduction rules. Finally, there is an alternative schematic presentation of definition by recursion.
The resulting theory is a flexible and powerful language for programming and constructive mathematics. We hint at the wealth of possible applications by showing several basic examples: predicate logic, generalised induction, and a formalisation of the untyped lambda calculus.},

In this paper we define a multithreaded functional language with session types, which unifies, simplifies and extends previous work. There are four main contributions. First: an operational semantics with buffered channels, instead of the synchronous communication of previous work. Second: we prove that the session type of a channel gives an upper bound on the necessary size of the buffer. Third: session types are manipulated by means of the standard structures of a linear type theory, rather than by means of new forms of typing judgement. Fourth: a notion of subtyping, including the standard subtyping relation for session types (imported into the functional setting), and a novel form of subtyping between standard and linear function types which allows the typechecker to handle linear types conveniently. Our new approach significantly simplifies session types in the functional setting, clarifies their essential features, and provides a secure foundation for language developments such as polymorphism and object-orientation.},

We start by giving a higher-order abstract syntax encoding of {$\pi$}-calculus in the higher-order inductive/coinductive-type theories CIC and CC(Co)Ind. This encoding gives rise to a full-fledged proof editor/proof assistant for the {$\pi$}-calculus, once we embed it in Coq, an interactive proof-development environment for CC(Co)Ind. Using this computerized assistant we prove formally a substantial chapter of the theory of strong late bisimilarity, which amounts essentially to Section 2 of A calculus of mobile processes by Milner, Parrow, and Walker. This task is greatly simplified by the use of higher-order syntax. In fact, not only we can delegate conveniently to the metalanguage {$\alpha$}-conversion and substitution, but, introducing a suitable axiomatization of the theory of contexts, we can accommodate also the machinery for generating new names. The axiomatization we introduce is quite general and should be easily portable to other formalizations based on higher-order syntax. The use of coinductive types and corresponding tactics allows to give alternative, and possibly more natural, proofs of many properties of strong late bisimilarity, w.r.t. those originally given by Milner, Parrow, and Walker.},

We present a system of blame assignment in the case when the monitor detects an undesirable action and an alarm is raised. We prove that dynamic monitoring does not change system behavior for welltyped processes, and that one of an indicated set of possible culprits must have been compromised in case of an alarm.},

We begin by presenting a variant of Wadler's session-typed core functional language, GV. We give a small-step operational semantics for GV. We develop a suitable notion of deadlock, based on existing approaches for capturing deadlock in {$\pi$}-calculus, and show that all well-typed GV programs are deadlock-free, deterministic, and terminating. We relate GV to linear logic by giving translations between GV and CP, a process calculus with a type system and semantics based on classical linear logic. We prove that both directions of our translation preserve reduction; previous translations from GV to CP, in contrast, failed to preserve {$\beta$}-reduction. Furthermore, to demonstrate the modularity of our approach, we define two extensions of GV which preserve deadlock-freedom, determinism, and termination.},

  abstract = {Work to date on combining linear types and dependent types has deliberately and successfully avoided doing so. Entirely fit for their own purposes, such systems wisely insist that types depend only on the replicable sublanguage, thus sidestepping the issue of counting uses of limited-use data either within types or in ways which are only really needed to shut the typechecker up. As a result, the linear implication (`lollipop') stubbornly remains a non-dependent \$\$S \textbackslash{}backslashmultimap T\$\$S{$\multimap$}T. This paper defines and establishes the basic metatheory of a type theory supporting a `dependent lollipop' \$\$(x\textbackslash{}backslash!:\textbackslash{}backslash!S)\textbackslash{}backslashmultimap T[x]\$\$(x:S){$\multimap$}T[x], where what the input used to be is in some way commemorated by the type of the output. For example, we might convert list to length-indexed vectors in place by a function with type \$\$(l\textbackslash{}backslash!:\textbackslash{}backslash!\textbackslash{}backslashmathsf \{List\}\textbackslash{}backslash,X)\textbackslash{}backslashmultimap \textbackslash{}backslashmathsf \{Vector\}\textbackslash{}backslash,X\textbackslash{}backslash,(\textbackslash{}backslashmathsf \{length\}\textbackslash{}backslash,l)\$\$(l:ListX){$\multimap$}VectorX(lengthl). Usage is tracked with resource annotations belonging to an arbitrary rig, or `riNg without Negation'. The key insight is to use the rig's zero to mark information in contexts which is present for purposes of contemplation rather than consumption, like a meal we remember fondly but cannot eat twice. We need no runtime copies of l to form the above vector type. We can have plenty of nothing with no additional runtime resource, and nothing is plenty for the construction of dependent types.},

  abstract = {Abstract. This paper proposes two typing systems for session interactions in higherorder mobile processes. Session types for the HO{$\pi$}-calculus capture high-level structures of communication protocols and code mobility as type abstraction, and can be used to statically check the safe and consistent process composition in communication-centric distributed software. Integration of arbitrary higher-order code mobility and sessions leads to technical difficulties in type soundness, because linear usage of session channels and completion of sessions are required in executed code. By using techniques from the linear {$\lambda$}-calculus, we develop a coherent and tractable session typing system for the HO{$\pi$}-calculus. We also present an alternative system based on fine-grained process types. The formal comparison between the two systems offers insight on the interplay between higher-order code mobility and session types. 1},

  abstract = {DOMINIC ORCHARD, University of Kent, UK VILEM-BENJAMIN LIEPELT, University of Kent, UK HARLEY EADES III, Augusta University, USA In programming, some data acts as a resource (e.g., file handles, channels) subject to usage constraints. This poses a challenge to software correctness as most languages are agnostic to constraints on data. The approach of linear types provides a partial remedy, delineating data into resources to be used but never copied or discarded, and unconstrained values. Bounded Linear Logic provides a more fine-grained approach, quantifying non-linear use via an indexed-family of modalities. Recent work on coeffect types generalises this idea to graded comonads, providing type systems which can capture various program properties. Here, we propose the umbrella notion of graded modal types, encompassing coeffect types and dual notions of type-based effect reasoning via graded monads. In combination with linear and indexed types, we show that graded modal types provide an expressive type theory for quantitative program reasoning, advancing the reach of type systems to capture and verify a broader set of program properties. We demonstrate this approach via a type system embodied in a fully-fledged functional language called Granule, exploring various examples.

The pi-calculus provides a conceptual framework for understanding mobility, and mathematical tools for expressing systems and reasoning about their behaviors.
The book serves both as a reference for the theory and as an extended demonstration of how to use pi-calculus to describe systems and analyze their properties. It covers the basic theory of pi-calculus, typed pi-calculi, higher-order processes, the relationship between pi-calculus and lambda-calculus, and applications of pi-calculus to object-oriented design and programming.

The typing system enjoys a subject-reduction property and possesses a notion of principal typing-scheme. Furthermore, the algorithm to reconstruct the principal typing-scheme of a process, or to detect its inexistence, is proved correct with respect to the typing system.   1.

  abstract = {We present a formalization of session types in a multi-threaded lambda-calculus (MTLC) equipped with a linear type system, establishing for the MTLC both type preservation and global progress. The latter (global progress) implies that the evaluation of a well-typed program in the MTLC can never reach a deadlock. As this formulated MTLC can be readily embedded into ATS, a full-fledged language with a functional programming core that supports both dependent types (of DML-style) and linear types, we obtain a direct implementation of session types in ATS. In addition, we gain immediate support for a form of dependent session types based on this embedding into ATS. Compared to various existing formalizations of session types, we see the one given in this paper is unique in its closeness to concrete implementation. In particular, we report such an implementation ready for practical use that generates Erlang code from well-typed ATS source (making use of session types), thus taking great advantage of the infrastructural support for distributed computing in Erlang.},

  abstract = {In this paper we present an automatic verification technique for pa- rameterized systems where the subsystem behavior is modeled using the - calculus. At its core, our technique treats each process instance in a system as a property transformer. Given a property ' that we want to verify of an N -process system, we use a partial model checker to infer the property '0 (stated as a for- mula in a sufficiently rich logic) that must hold of an (N 1)-process system. If the sequence of formulas ','0,... thus constructed converges, and the limit is satisfied by the deadlocked process, we can conclude that the N -process system satisfies '. To this end, we develop a partial model checker for the -calculus that uses an expressive value-passing logic as the property language. We also develop a number of optimizations to make the model checker efficient enough for routine use, and a light-weight widening operator to accelerate convergence. We demon- strate the effectiveness of our technique by using it to verify properties of a wide variety of parameterized systems that are beyond the reach of existing techniques.},

@phdthesis{Zalakain2018,
  abstract = {The Curry-Howard correspondence draws a direct link between logic and computation: propositions are modelled as types and proofs as programs; to prove a proposition is to construct a program inhabiting its corresponding type. Several computer-assisted theorem provers have been developed under this idea. They are not just used to verify human reasoning: they are also often capable of generating proofs automatically.

This project considers the development of such automated theorem provers in Agda, a dependently typed programming language. As a warm-up, I present a verified solver for equations on monoids. Then, I comment on the solver for commutative rings included in Agda's standard library. Finally, I develop a verified decision procedure for Presburger arithmetic \textemdash{} a decidable first-order predicate logic.},
